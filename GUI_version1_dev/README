Basic version.

Capabilties:
 - choose any branch from tree disc and cont variables
 - plot with user-inputted bin number and range
 - fit with polynomial and gauss function
 	- fit mean is chosen range midpoint
	- fit std is mean/10
 - separate cont using user-inputted signal and sideband regions
 - calculate weight
 - conduct sideband subtract on cont variable in disc chosen signal range

Required improvements:
 - add legend
 - a basic draw function with no fitting so user can chose range
 - a separate fit function (and button) which doesn't allow fit variables with zero difference (eg sig max=0 and sig min =0)
 - gives error if it can't fit
 - gives error if below left sideband or above right sideband or if there is any overlap
